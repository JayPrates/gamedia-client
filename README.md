<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Description

For the final project of the bootcamp we were required to build a full-stack application using MERN Stack and all the skills we learned over the course of the 9 week curriculum.
Gamedia is a social media web application made to connect all gamers though individual game communities by allowing them to share experiences on posts that they make.
